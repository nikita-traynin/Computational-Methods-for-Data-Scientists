To run:
1. Install python. The default installation should come with pip, which is required.
2. *Preferably in a virtual environment*, run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'. This will install necessary dependencies, which include all of the fundamental data science libraries.
3. Run 'python -m main'. This will run all of the code I used to obtain any and all results in the report. There are many commented print statements which will show you any intermediate results.
